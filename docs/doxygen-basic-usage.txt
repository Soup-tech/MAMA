Doxygen exe is located in MAMA/docs/build/bin

./doxygen Doxyfile

This will write all the docs to MAMAM/doc/html
The basic syntax to writting documents for your methods is:

/**
 * Brief explanation
 * 
 * Detailed explaination
 *
 * @param param_1
 * @param param_2
 *
 * @return Return stuff
*/  

For constants, variables, structs and other stuff:

/// Brief explanation
