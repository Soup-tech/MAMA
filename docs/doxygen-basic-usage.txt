Doxygen exe is located in MAMA/docs/build/bin

./doxygen Doxyfile

This will write all the docs to MAMAM/doc/html
The basic syntax to writting documents for your methods is:

/**
 * Brief explanation
 * 
 * Detailed explaination
 *
 * @param param_1
 * @param param_2
 *
 * @return Return stuff
*/  

For constants, variables, structs and other stuff:

/// Brief explanation

A small note: In the Doxyfile, there is a bunch of configurations such as where to read the source files and where to write the docs to. Right now they are
specific to my machine so if you want to generate your own results you'll need to change these. Or you can just message me and I'll generate the docs for you.
Your call.
