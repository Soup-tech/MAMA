Two phases in this module:
	1. Implementing the heap manager and testing as a stand-alone program
	2. Integrating the module into your MPX

Intro:
	- Memory blocks are tracked through Complete Memory Control Blocks (CMCB) as 
	well as Limited Memory Control Blocks (LMCB) data structures
	- Blocks are stored in one of two lists, free block list or allocated block list

Memory Control Blocks
	CMCBs contain:
		Type - indicating free or allocated
		Beginning Address
		Size - Size of block in bytes
		Name - Name of process (PCB) that is housed in the block
		Links to the next and previous block of the same type
	LMCBs contain:
		Type - Indicating free or allocated
		Size - Indicating size in bytes of the block



****** Allocated Work ******
Part I. Implemented Methods
- See slides 7 to 18 for details on the below methods
	Initialize Heap		[x] Maximillian 
	Allocate Memory		[x] Maximillian
	Free Memory		[x] Abdullah
	isEmpty			[x] Abdullah
	Show Free Memory	[x] Austin
	Show Allocated Memory	[] Mohammad 

Part II. Integration into MPX
- See slide 19 and 20 for details on this part
- Initialize heap to ~50 KB									[]
- Call sys_int with MEM_MODULE. Indicates that memory management module has been implemented	[]
- Call "sys_set_malloc" and "sys_set_free" to override default kmalloc and kfree
  calling your allocateMemory and freeMemory instead						[]
- Remove any methods that would allow the user to allocate/deallocate memory 			[]
