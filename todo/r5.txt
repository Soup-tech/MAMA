Two phases in this module:
	1. Implementing the heap manager and testing as a stand-alone program
	2. Integrating the module into your MPX

Intro:
	- Memory blocks are tracked through Complete Memory Control Blocks (CMCB) as 
	well as Limited Memory Control Blocks (LMCB) data structures
	- Blocks are stored in one of two lists, free block list or allocated block list

Memory Control Blocks
	CMCBs contain:
		Type - indicating free or allocated
		Beginning Address
		Size - Size of block in bytes
		Name - Name of process (PCB) that is housed in the block
		Links to the next and previous block of the same type
	LMCBs contain:
		Type - Indicating free or allocated
		Size - Indicating size in bytes of the block
